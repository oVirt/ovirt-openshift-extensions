Implementation of flexvolume driver for [oVirt](https://ovirt.org) and a dynamic volume provisioner

oVirt flexvolume driver is attachable, i.e. it supports attaching/detaching storage volumes from nodes, by detaching them from the underlying VM.

Here is a short [demo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_E9pUVrI0hs):\

The project creates 3 containers:
1. **`ovirt-flexvolume-driver`**
   A container that exist to install the binary on the host, immediately sleeps
forever. Used in a daemonset deployment - see the apb.
2. **`ovirt-volume-provisioner`**
   A container for the provisioner controller. Used in a deployment - see
apb
3. **`ovirt-flexvolume-driver-apb`**
  An apb container that will deploy both the driver and the provisioner.
  One can use the service catalog to push the apb there and use it or straight from the command line.
  See the apb Makefile currently under [deployment/ovirt-flexvolume-driver/Makefile](deployment/ovirt-flexvolume-driver/Makefile).

# Deployment
There are 2 main deployment methods: using a deployment container(recommended) or manual

## Deploy using the deployment container(APB) and service-catalog(recommended)

Pre-requisite:
- Openshift 3.9.0
- Running service catalog

1. push the apb image to your cluster repo
   ```
   make apb_build apb_push
   ```
2. go to the service catalog UI and deploy the ovirt-flexvolume-driver-apb. Here is a demo doing that:
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=frcehKUk_g4" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/frcehKUk_g4/0.jpg" alt="IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE" width="240" height="180" border="10" /></a>

## Deploy Manually

1. make sure `oc` command is configured and has access to your cluster, e.g run `oc status`

2. run this command, but change the `--extra-vars` section to match your ovirt-engine details

   ```
   docker run \
     --rm \
     --net=host \
     -v $HOME/.kube:/opt/apb/.kube:z \
     -u $UID docker.io/rgolangh/ovirt-flexvolume-driver-apb \
     provision \
     --extra-vars '{"admin_password":"developer","admin_user":"developer","cluster":"openshift","namespace":"default","engine_password":"123","engine_url":"https://your_engine_hostname:28443/ovirt-engine/api","engine_username":"admin@internal"}'
   ```

   - If its the first time deploying the image then it should take few moments to download it.

Upon completion you have the components running:

   ```
   oc get ds -n default ovirt-flexvolume-driver 
   name                      desired   current   ready     up-to-date   available   node selector   age
   ovirt-flexvolume-driver   1         1         1         1            1           <none>          15m

   oc get deployment -n default ovirt-volume-provisioner 
   NAME                       DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
   ovirt-volume-provisioner   1         1         1            1           17m
   ```

# Project pre-requisite
  - Running ovirt 4.1 instance (support for disk_attachments API)
  - k8s 1.9 (possibly working on 1.8, untested)
  - Every k8s minion name should match its VM name

# Make targets
There are few make targets for building the artifacts:
- `make deps`      - get and install the project dependencies
- `make build`     - build the flexvolume driver and provisioner binaries
- `make rpm`       - builds and rpm from the previously created binaries
- `make container` - creates the containers
- `make apb_*`     - {build, push, docker_push} for the apb container life cycle
